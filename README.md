# What is Venus?
Venus is a Dock Widget for your desktops interface. It adds a couple of really cool widgets and various fabrics to your desktop. It is currently still in Beta so small bugs are to be expected, At the moment Venus supports a Date-&-Time Widget, But in the near future releases more awesome widgets will be added with a configurable menu

# What language is Venus Written in?
Venus BackEnd is written in Pure Python from top to bottom. Its interface uses the PyQt libary version 5

# Is Venus an Open-Source Project?
No! Venus is not an Open-Source Project (Atm Currently). [SecretsX](https://github.com/SecretsX), the creator of this Project has not yet decided to make it an Open-Source project. But might as well in the near future

# Is Venus Safe To Use?
Yes! Venus is a 101% Safe to use application. The application is highly obfuscated using multiple excrytions/obfuscations to prevent any code leak. Venus uses different methods to override the default windows behaviour for applications so it can perform as a dock widget and stick to your desktop and not over other applications and prevent from getting minimized.
