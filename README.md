# What is Venus?
Venus is a Dock Widget for your desktops interface. It adds a couple of really cool widgets and various fabrics to your desktop. It is currently still in Beta so small bugs are to be expected, At the moment Venus supports a Date-&-Time Widget, But in the near future releases more awesome widgets will be added with a configurable menu

# What language is Venus Written in?
Venus BackEnd is written in Pure Python from top to bottom. Its interface uses the PyQt libary version 5

# Why are some parts Obfuscated? [!Read This!]
Thats cause Venus wasn't meant to be an open-source project earlier at all. But I just made the project open source as am not willing to keep it a obfuscated-secured application anymore. Parts of the Repository is still Obfuscated as it was uploaded earlier, To View the Non Obfuscated and Clean Code check the `src` folder in the repo. It contains all new fresh and nonfuscated code to read and use.
